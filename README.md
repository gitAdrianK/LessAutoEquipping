Gives you the ability to prevent auto equipping of items, be it crowns at the end of the game or world items.

Note that the normal and new babe ending will still show the crown being equipped as it is baked into the sprite. Nothing I can do there.

Information for other modders:
If your mod patches the class GiveWearableItemNode method MyRun or WorldItemComp method OnPickup be aware that this mod prevents it from running in a prefix if enabled!
